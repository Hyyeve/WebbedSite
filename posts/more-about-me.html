        I started 'programming' when I was around 8-9y, in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms">lego mindstorms</a> kits, a
        series of lego robotics sets with a fairly complex custom drag-n-drop programming system.
      </p>

            you could make some pretty cool things!
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Over a few years I managed to collect the majority of the sets (RCX through to EV3) and spent a lot of time building
        strange and fun contraptions with them - vehicles, creatures, but mainly what interested me was more technical and complex
        machines.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Printing' (by holding and moving a pen), sorting objects by color, even solving rubik's cubes were possible with
        enough dedication. I didn't have the skill at programming to design the algorithms from scratch, but I followed tutorials and tried to
        understand what was going on in the flow-chart-like scripts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Eventually though, I moved on to <a href="https://smallbasic-publicwebsite.azurewebsites.net/">Small Basic</a>,
        a very simple programming language designed for educational use by microsoft. I made quite a few random small
        programs with it - very simple calculators, password checker, and, notably, a few <strong>graphical experiments.</strong>
      </p>

        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        I didn't really do much past that at the time though; not long after I got distracted by interests in music production and video editing/vfx,
        and pretty much stopped doing any programming for several years.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned a lot about video editing (and to a lesser degree, music production) during those years, and those interests still persist -
        I've done a significant amount of video editing since, including with quite complex VFX (<a href="https://youtu.be/R9tKjUm12ic">see this latest example</a>),
        and have been learning more <strong>music theory</strong> lately...
      </p>

      <p>
        At some point in there I also attempted to follow an Unreal/C++ game development course, and did manage some working C++ and
        a very unfinished Unreal 4 project, but I didn't really pursue it very far at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I really got back into programming was when I started gaining an interest in <a href="https://minecraft.net">minecraft</a> modding.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started working a lot on my own minecraft 'utility mods', and through constantly writing and re-writing features I started to get a real
        understanding of software architecture and how to write 'good' code, as well as learning quite a lot about OpenGL
        (the graphics API used by minecraft) in the process. <br>
      </p>

      <p>
        From there, I decided I wanted to pursue more programming and game development,
        and started learning <a href="https://unity.com">Unity</a> and C# - which, being essentially microsoft flavoured java,
        was very easy to move onto. Unity itself took a bit more learning, but I was getting the hang of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then, two tings happened at about the same time - a friend introduced me to
        <a href="https://revision-party.net/">Revision</a> (and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene">demoscene</a>),
        and I started a [uk; college, us; highschool] gamedev course.
      </p>

      <p>
        With all the time I'd already spent on programming and gamedev, I cruised through the gamedev course very easily - most of the time a
        few steps ahead of whatever the course was teaching. And in the meantime, I'd gotten a little obsessed with <strong>shaders</strong>.
        But not the regular everyday draw-your-app-onto-the-screen kind of shaders. No. Something much more <strong>artistic.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the events that revision runs is called Shader Showdown - a live-coding competition between several skilled shader coders.
        The goal? Make something as impressive, and pretty, as possible. From scratch. In 25 minutes. Raw GLSL.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sounds difficult, right? Writing any complex 3D scene in a shader in 25 minutes must be almost impossible, right?
        Especially if you want it to be animated and maybe even music reactive?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Oh.</strong>
      </p>

      </div>

      <p>
        I highly recommend you <a href="https://youtu.be/NBdRfFwuP40?t=3663">take a look</a> at the live, fully animated version of
        this shader. It's pretty incredible.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was watching the event live, and the only thought in my head the whole time was 'woah. I need to learn how to do this'.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, I did! I started learning the techniques and tricks used to create these kinds of incredible artistic shaders, in the
        downtime I had from my course. I have a lot of works up on <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/user/Hyeve">Shadertoy</a>,
        if you're interested in seeing them!
      </p>

      <p>
        After finishing the gamedev course (you can see my <strong>final project</strong> from it <a href="https://github.com/Hyyeve/Coloris">here</a>,
        I applied and was accepted to a university 'technical game development' (programming-focused) course.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, since I'd been learning so much beyond my previous course already, and so much outside of that, I found the
        university course content to not really be very engaging - spending weeks of lectures on concepts I already mostly knew and could
        very quickly grasp in my own time.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I decided to take a year out from university and try and go straight into work, thinking that
        if I didn't find employment, I'd go back and finish the degree.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I never needed to! By some very lucky chance, I managed to get an internship with a small VR games studio
        just as they were looking to get funding to employ more people and bring their new game to completion - and they decided
        I was worth hiring!
      </p>

      <p>
        And that's pretty much where I am today, though with a couple years more learning and experience on top of everything.
        If you're interested in the things I'm doing these days, keep an eye on the projects and posts sections for new additions and updates.
