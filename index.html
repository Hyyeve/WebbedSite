      Hewwo! I go by <strong>hyeve (she/they)</strong> online, though people usually shorten it to just eve.
      I'm a fully self-taught <strong>game developer & generalist programmer,</strong> with a particular interest in <strong>graphics</strong> and artistic projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been coding in various forms for <strong>over a decade</strong> now!
    </p>
    <p>
      Particularly notable skills include <br> <strong> Unity, C++, OpenGL, GLSL, HLSL, and C#, </strong> <br> all of which I'm very comfortable with and have been using in both <strong>personal and professional</strong> projects for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm also pretty capable at <strong>video editing</strong> (over 100 completed freelance videos!), and have at least had a go at pretty much all creative digital work -
      <strong>design, digital art </strong>(both 3D and 2D),<strong> music,</strong> etc.
