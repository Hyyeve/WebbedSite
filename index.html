  <script type="module" src="js/index.js" async></script>
  <!--
    the `async` tag will make the script load asynchronously without blocking the page
    the scripts are also executed before the page has fully finished loading!
    there's a `defer` tag that makes the script run after, but it's much better to do

      window.addEventListener("load", () => {
        // do stuff after the page loads and all the content is available
        // and can be queried using document.getElementById/document.querySelector and modified
      });

    for example, in case you want to get some data, you can do a request while the page is still loaded and display the dynamic content right after
    so that looks like the page loaded with the dynamic content already being there

    you can also add more scripts, but it's much better to use type="module"
    which lets you use `import` and `export` in the script:

      import { doStuff } from "./something.js";
      import "./something-else.js";

      export const SOME_CONSTANT = 69;

      export function doMoreStuff() {
        ...
      }

    if you have multiple script tags, it'll be much harder to maintain the code since you will have to ensure the right order of imports in this HTML file,
    and everything will just be defined globally instead of being able to export things from one file and import from another

      Hewwo! I go by <strong>hyeve (she/they)</strong> online, though people usually shorten it to just eve.
      I'm a fully self-taught <strong>game developer & generalist programmer,</strong> with a particular interest in <strong>graphics</strong> and artistic projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been coding in various forms for <strong>over a decade</strong> now!
    </p>
    <p>
      Particularly notable skills include <br> <strong> Unity, C++, OpenGL, GLSL, HLSL, and C#, </strong> <br> all of which I'm very comfortable with and have been using in both <strong>personal and professional</strong> projects for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm also pretty capable at <strong>video editing</strong> (over 100 completed freelance videos!), and have at least had a go at pretty much all creative digital work -
      <strong>design, digital art </strong>(both 3D and 2D),<strong> music,</strong> etc.
